# Initial Thinking

* Multidimensional array
* Need to evaluate each element against each other
* Need to count the total number of valid passwords

## Initial Solution
* Loop through each array
* Loop generates regex that evaluates password
* If password fails increase counter
* Loop limited by total number of elements in the array
# Test Possibilities
* 
# Could do...
* Visual representation of the data via a table with a pass fail colour
